# PHPQuery
This program is used to query a sql database and post into a localhost. It is later on used for IOS app. 

To avoid creating queries from a mobile application, a php localhost simple website may be doing the queries acting like a web server.

We are currently using this program to be read by our IOS mobile application which needs class information from The University of Texas at El Paso.
